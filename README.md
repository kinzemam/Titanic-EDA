# Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. The goal is to extract meaningful insights using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

This project is intended as a beginner-friendly end-to-end data analysis portfolio project.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains the following features:

- PassengerId – Unique ID of each passenger  
- Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  
- Pclass – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- Name – Passenger name  
- Sex – Gender  
- Age – Age in years  
- SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- Parch – Number of parents/children aboard  
- Ticket – Ticket number  
- Fare – Ticket fare  
- Cabin – Cabin number  
- Embarked – Port of embarkation

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked.
- Checked dataset structure and consistency.

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of Survival
- Passenger Class distribution
- Gender distribution
- Age distribution

### 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Survival vs Gender
- Survival vs Passenger Class
- Survival vs Age
- Survival vs Fare

### 4. Correlation Analysis
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features to identify key relationships.

### 5. Multivariate Analysis
- Survival analysis based on both Gender and Passenger Class.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- First class passengers had the highest probability of survival.
- Higher fare passengers were more likely to survive.
- Age showed a weak correlation with survival.
- Economic and social class played a major role in survival outcomes.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build a machine learning model to predict survival.
- Perform feature engineering.
- Compare different classification algorithms.

---

## ✅ Project Status
Completed EDA. Machine Learning modeling will be added next.
